# Program of Thought (PoT) Prompting
A Python implementation that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve problems by generating, executing, and interpreting code.
Overview
Program of Thought (PoT) Prompting is an advanced prompting technique that enables LLMs to solve complex problems by:

1. Reasoning about the problem
2. Writing executable code to solve it
3. Executing the code
4. Interpreting the results

This approach combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the computational precision of code execution.

**Features**

1. Structured prompting to guide the LLM's reasoning process
2. Automatic code extraction from LLM responses
3. Safe code execution in a controlled environment
4. Result integration for final answer generation
5. Output formatting

**Installation:**

- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/program-of-thought.git
- cd program-of-thought 
- pip install openai #make sure to have authorization credentials
- python POT.py #run
